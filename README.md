# Amphi Notes

Amphi Notes is a free and open-source, cross-platform note-taking app.<br>
You can insert images and videos into your notes, and format your text.<br>
Organize your notes using folders, just like a traditional file system.<br>
Once you've written your notes or stories, you can sync them across devices via a self-hosted server.
