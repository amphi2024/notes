  Amphi Notes is a free and open-source, cross-platform note-taking app.
  You can insert images and videos into your notes, and format your text.
  Organize your notes using folders, just like a traditional file system.
  Once you've written your notes or stories, you can sync them across devices via a self-hosted server.
  If you want to host your server, visit our homepage: https://amphi.site
